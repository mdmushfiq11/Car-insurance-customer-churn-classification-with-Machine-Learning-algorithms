Explored the dataset with 85 predictor variables and one target variable with binary classes.

Balanced the dataset and employed feature engineering techniques like missing value imputation, categorical variables identification, etc.

Applied plain vanilla machine learning models and then tried to optimize the models with GridSearch embedded with 5-fold cross validation.

Gradient bossting provided the best performance in both plain and optimizaed versions.
